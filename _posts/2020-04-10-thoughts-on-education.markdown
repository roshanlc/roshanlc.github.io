 <span style="font-size: 15pt">To begin with, we, humans, almost all of us are always in  conflict(s). </span>  Most of us crave success, want to be famous, to be this and  to be that, and so on.  We live a sophisticated life, always in  confusion. When we are in confusion, how can our actions be unbiased? I  have my own problems, my own idiosyncrasies then how can my actions and  thoughts ever be free of confusion. While investigating into this matter  deeply, most of our problems lead to one core thing, that is education.  

Have we ever thought in-depth about our education? You see, our  education(-system) is rather bloated. It only gives priority to the  outer, the technological world and so on. But the most important  education is psychological education. One must know oneself. Knowing  oneself is as important as learning mathematics, science and other  various subjects. Our basic education is rather false. Instead of rather  teaching a human to live a humble life, we are taught to be successful  and this-and-that. This is rather stupid. The true essence of education  is to make a human life free of problems and conflicts but see what have  humans become. One hates another in the name of this-and-that and is  ready to take the life of another. This is what our education is. It  doesnâ€™t mean that all the technological and medical advancement is bad.  Our education has taught us, division. Divided by this-and-that, we live  a life full of conflicts. When we, humans, are in inner-conflict, we  inflict conflicts in this world. So basically, we are living a life full  of inner-and-outer conflicts.

Sorrow, pain, grief, emotions and so  on. Has our education ever taught us about it?  We are taught only to  suppress it, control it. This only increase conflicts one way or  another. We are shaped to think like this and like that. But no emphasis  is given to whereabouts of thoughts. We have become thought-machines.  Is there a moment when we are free of thoughts. Endless thoughts and  endless conflicts. Do you see what these schools and institutions have  done to us? These competitions and school programs are stupid, if you  truly see. They only boost your ego, your envy, which rather acts as a  catalyst. These things only cloud our mind. And with a clouded mind, we  live a life full of turmoils.
