# A Short course on git and github
Last month, with the help of our student club (tech club), I conducted a short crash course on git and github at our college.
There were more people present there than we had expected. So, it was a beneficial experience.

#### Presentation file of that short crash course
Head over to its github repository and clone it from there.

##### Lastly, the flyer that I designed for that event.
